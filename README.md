# Cart.js
Cart.js is a Javascript library that makes it easy to add dynamic cart features
to Shopify themes.

It abstracts away the difficult parts of working with Shopify's AJAX API and
provides a simple, consistent interface to manipulating a customer's cart.
Without having to worry about the quirks in Shopify's endpoints or about making
all of your requests synchronous, you can just write code like this:

```js
function example() {
  // Clear the existing cart.
  CartJS.clear();

  // Add 3x "12345678" items, with a custom "size" property of "XL".
  CartJS.addItem(12345678, 3, {
    "size": "XL"
  });

  // Add multiple items in a single call. 
  CartJS.addItems([
    {
      id: 12345678,
      quantity: 3,
      properties: {
        "size": "XL"
      }
    },
    {
      id: 87654321,
      quantity: 2
    }
  ]);

  // Set a custom cart note.
  CartJS.setNote('This is a custom cart note.');
}
```

Neat, huh? But that's just the beginning.

Cart.js bundles two powerful optional modules that make it even easier to build
dynamic carts into your themes:


### Data API Module
Lets you use simple `data-*` markup attributes to hook in to Cart.js methods,
without having to write *any* Javascript yourself.

For example, to create a button that added a particular product to your cart,
all that's required is:

```html
<button data-cart-add="12345678">Add Product</button>
```


### DOM Binding Module
In combination with [Rivets.js][], the DOM Binding module lets you write HTML
templates in your `.liquid` files that are re-rendered dynamically when the
contents of your cart change, like this:

```html
<div data-cart-view>
    You currently have {cart.item_count} item(s) in your cart, for a total of {cart.total_price | money_with_currency}.
</div>
```


## Getting Started and Documentation
Documentation and examples are available on the [home page][].

You can check out a list of who's using Cart.js in production on the
[Built with Cart.js][] page.

## Dependencies
Cart.js currently depends on [jQuery][] for its AJAX helpers, custom event
bindings and utility methods. This usually isn't a problem as most Shopify
themes ship with jQuery.

[Rivets.js] is required if you want to use the DOM Binding module. The
distribution of Cart.js includes a minified asset (`rivets-cart.min.js`) which
contains both the Cart.js library and a bundled version of Rivets.js.
