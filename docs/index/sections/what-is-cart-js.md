## What is Cart.js?

Cart.js is a very small open source Javascript library that makes the addition of powerful Ajax cart functionality to your Shopify theme a breeze.

It's designed to be simple to use, while providing some really powerful and nifty features, like:

- **Simple, consistent API** for cart manipulation;
- **Data API** for markup-only use without needing to write a line of Javascript;
- **DOM Binding** to dynamically render HTML templates as your cart changes.

You don't need to worry about ensuring your Ajax requests are synchronous, binding event listeners, or updating the DOM.
